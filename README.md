# Overview

This program is a simple cloud-based shopping cart / store system. It allows you to see and lodify a list of products stored in the cloud. It also allows you to modify a shopping cart that will estimate the total cost of products inside.

This program creates a connection to a Google Firebase Firestore database in order to retrieve or modify data in the "store".

The purpose of writing this software was to learn how Google Cloud Databases work, and how to interact with them.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
